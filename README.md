I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to see what I was capable of doing with Processing. I decided to animate a song by an artist I admire, Childish Gambino, from his last album, because the internet. I was hoping to build something with a really glitchy aesthetic, and I thought that the album as a whole could easily accompany anything in that set really well. I chose the song because itâ€™s one of my favorites on the album and it ran just over a two minute time requirement.

The result is up on Vimeo here: https://vimeo.com/104674099
